# Summary
This was a e-commerce full stack web application I developed for my Internet Applications class at NJIT. A full explanation and demonstration of the features of the application can be seen in the video above. The following technologies were used:
- PHP
- JavaScript (including jQuery and AJAX)
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- SQL (MySQL)
While this web application used to be deployed on Heroku, it isn't anymore as the free plan has been removed.
